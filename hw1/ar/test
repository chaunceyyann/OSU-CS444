To test the correctness of the solution to the producer and consumer problem. We designed a print out funtion that print everything from the buffer when buffer changes its content. The print out includes who made the change(includes thread id), the new elements been push\/pop from the buffer, and the elements of buffer. However, a nice looking print out does not enssure a perfect working solution. Thus we test the soluion with certain set of thread numbers and fixed sleep time for each type of threads. For example, when testing single thread producer and consumer, we set consumer sleep time at 4 seconds, set producer sleep time at 2 seconds. Thus, we can tell if the mutex actually working by crash consumer and producer together intentionally. During our test, we observed the single producer thread could produce item either before the consumer or after consumer consume the previous item from the buffer. For multiple producer and consumer threads, we used same fixed sleep time of producer and consumer for maxium collisions. The test results are positive and we moved on to finish this write up.
