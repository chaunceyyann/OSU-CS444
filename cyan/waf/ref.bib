The book details the major subsystems and features of the Linux kernel, including its design, implementation, and interfaces. An all-new chapter on kernel data structures give us the how the data structures are in the linux kernel. Extended coverage of virtual memory and memory allocation granted us the knowledge to allocate memory space as a hard drive space. It also provide tips on debugging the Linux kernel which makes every test of our project easier."
